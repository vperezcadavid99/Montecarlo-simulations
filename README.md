## Montecarlo-simulations

**1. Collision simulator at the LHC** 

In the following script, the Monte Carlo simulation of a particle collision experiment is carried out in the "Large Hadron Collider" (LCH), calculating the probability of collision for different events, taking into account different values of the particle radius..

**2. Drunkard's path**

This script describes the trajectory of a drunk person based on a set of logical steps and with a link to the number of steps. Additionally, the probability of reaching a specific distance within a total of possible events is calculated.

**3. Graphene network simulation**

An analysis of the magnetism of a spin-doped graphene network is carried out using Monte Carlo simulation.

**4. Academic Classifier**

In the following script a Dataframe is created with student information, which is used as a template for future classification analysis in educational institutions.

**5. N dice system**

A system of N givens is considered with N = 2,3 and 4. For each N, the distribution of the results of the sum of the values of the N given is determined by graphing the number of possible microstates (combinations) associated with each value of possible sum (macrostate).
